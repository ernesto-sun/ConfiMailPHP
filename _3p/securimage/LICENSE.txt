The GitHub-project is defined as 'no longer maintained' by the user 'dapphp'. 

The project-page automatically goes to a new branch called 'nextgen' and version 4.0.2. That branch
seemms untested to me. I was not happy with trying to use it. API-changes and architecture-changes. 

I deciced to keep with the well tested version 3.6.8. thats the latest in the 'master' branch. And,
this encourages me to add one feature:

----

New feature: A new captcha-type among: SI_CAPTCHA_STRING and SI_CAPTCHA_MATHEMATIC and SI_CAPTCHA_WORDS

The new type is called SI_CAPTCHA_MATHEMATIC_EASY and gives a very very simple math question as distorted picture

$img->captcha_type = Securimage::SI_CAPTCHA_MATHEMATIC_EASY

-----

Will likely make some other changes in future and also make it fit for PHP 8.1 etc.
